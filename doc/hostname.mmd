hostname 1.0.0
==============

Synopsis
--------

    CREATE EXTENSION hostname;

    SELECT hostname();
          hostname
    --------------------
     myhost.example.com

Description
-----------

This library contains a single PostgreSQL function, `hostname()`, which
returns the PostgreSQL server host name. The function uses `gethostname()`
to get the host name. If it fails, `NULL` will be returned. If you need it
not to return `NULL`, use `COALESCE()`:

    SELECT COALESCE(NULL, '[unknown]');
     coalesce  
    -----------
     [unknown]
